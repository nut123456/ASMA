Abstract
The Artemisinin Slime Mold Algorithm (ASMA) is a novel optimization technique that integrates the biological behavior of slime mold with the chemical properties of artemisinin, a compound renowned for its medicinal efficacy in treating malaria. This synergy enables an efficient search mechanism for solving complex optimization problems. In ASMA, slime mold agents explore the search space through a process akin to natural chemotaxis, while the artemisinin-inspired component enhances the search by guiding agents toward optimal regions through a controlled balance of exploration and exploitation. This hybrid approach allows ASMA to maintain a fine balance between exploring diverse areas of the search space and exploiting promising solutions. The influence of artemisinin enables rapid adjustments in the agents search patterns, ensuring faster and more accurate convergence toward the global optimum. In this study, ASMA is benchmarked against other state-of-the-art algorithms using the CEC 2017 test suite, demonstrating superior performance. The primary focus is on the size optimization of truss structures under frequency constraints, which presents a computationally intensive challenge due to the requirement for eigenvalue calculations. To address this challenge, the Largest Eigenvalues of Sparse Matrix (LESM) technique is utilized, significantly reducing computational time and making large-scale truss optimization feasible. The ASMA-LESM approach has been rigorously evaluated across a range of dome structures, from small to large scales, with results indicating that ASMA offers superior accuracy and efficiency in tackling these optimization challenges.
